## EXTREMELY LONG VERSION

Hi folks! My name is **sotsuba**, and I’m a fresher student at one of the most respected universities in Computer Science and Basic Science — **University of Science, VNUHCM, Vietnam**!

I currently focus on two main paths: **Computer Science**, because it’s an exciting field that touches nearly every aspect of technology; and **Machine Learning**, which I find endlessly fascinating (hehe).

I discovered **MLOps** as an inspiring intersection of my passion for Machine Learning and my interest in Software Engineering and System Operations. While I genuinely enjoy building models, I realized that it can feel tedious and limited if my projects remain just *one-and-done events*.

At first, I wanted my friends to easily access my projects as services, without running into unnecessary hurdles — and maybe think I’m a pretty cool person! 😄 But over time, my goals evolved. Now, I aim to broaden the reach of these services so they can help **people around the world** solve real problems more easily.

I hope this space becomes useful not just for me, but for anyone interested in learning and growing in these fields!
